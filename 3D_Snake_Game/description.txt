Assignment: 1: Computer Graphics

 The program is implemented in C++ using OpenGL. Main libraries used
are: GLUT (for graphics creation) and SOIL-Simple OpenGL Image Library
(For Textures).
 A mesh is created using glut functions, and some textures were given.
 Keyboard and mouse both are used for translation (of the bigger box for
moving around the screen) as well as changing camera view (lookAt()
function).
 The Grid has one-to-one relationship with both the cubes, whereas the
cubes moves on their own without affecting each other.
 The whole scene is lit from 10th coordinate in the Y-direction using the
glLightfv() function. Ambient and Diffuse intensities of light are also
considered using the same function.
 Viewports and perspective projections are used so that the models fits
the view, when the user resizes the window.
 Camera Positions can be changed using both the keyboard and mouse. If

the user scrolls the mouse up or down, the camera shifts in the Y-
direction. When the user presses the PGUP/PGDWN keys, the view changes

in X-direction and pressing the HOME/Insert keys transforms the z-
direction.

 The basic idea was to implement a 3D snake game.
